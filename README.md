# JB HI FI Retail Store Database Project

## Overview
This project entails the design and implementation of a theoretical database system for the retail store JB HI FI. The primary goal is to establish a structured data management system to efficiently store and manage various aspects of the store's operations including products, customers, sales, and inventory.

## Components
1. **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):** 
   - Designed an ERD to visualize the relationships between different entities within the database model. This serves as a blueprint for organizing and structuring the database.

2. **Database Schema Creation:**
   - Implemented the database schema using MySQL. Created the necessary tables based on the entities identified in the ERD.

3. **Data Population:**
   - Wrote INSERT statements in MySQL to populate the database with sample data. This step ensures that the database is initialized with relevant information for testing and demonstration purposes.

4. **Query Development:**
   - Developed a set of generic queries to retrieve information from the database. These queries cover common scenarios such as product search, customer information retrieval, sales analysis, etc.

## Files Included
- `ERD.png`: Entity-Relationship Diagram illustrating the database schema.
- `create_tables.sql`: MySQL script containing CREATE TABLE statements for database schema creation.
- `insert_data.sql`: MySQL script containing INSERT statements for populating the database.
- `queries.sql`: MySQL script containing generic queries for database operations.

## Usage
1. **Database Setup:**
   - Execute the `create_tables.sql` script to create the necessary tables in your MySQL environment.

2. **Data Population:**
   - Run the `insert_data.sql` script to populate the tables with sample data.

3. **Query Execution:**
   - Utilize the `queries.sql` script to execute various queries and retrieve information from the database.
